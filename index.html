    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><a href="https://github.com/stobbsm/go-semver">go-semver</a> is a semantic version library for your go projects. I've used it with clients, and it simplifies having a semantic version consistent with the rest of the world.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><a href="https://github.com/stobbsm/filebrowser">filebrowser</a> provides abstractions for working with files in PHP. Very basic right now, but has potential. I'm going to be working on this a lot.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><a href="https://github.com/stobbsm/photogallery">photogallery</a> is a laravel based web application. I made it so my wife could more easily browse our photo library that is stored on our home server. Has potential to be more.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"><a href="https://github.com/stobbsm/sysmanager">sysmanager</a> was started because I don't like webmin, and don't see any real competition for it yet. Very slowly working on it, with the key to it being a modern design.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><a href="https://github.com/stobbsm/diceroll">diceroll</a> parses DND style dice roll strings and rolls the dice. Made in PHP to integrate into other web applications I'm planning on making.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><a href="https://github.com/stobbsm/go-externalip">go-externalip</a> gets your external ip address (v4 and v6, if available) from behind a nat. Very basic, should probably be made to not rely on external sites.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger"><a href="https://github.com/stobbsm/bashext">bashext</a> is a basic (very basic) bash plugin system I made to provide some more useful commands. Don't really use it much anymore, but it exists and maybe it's useful.</li>
